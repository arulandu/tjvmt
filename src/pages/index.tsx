Being a froshmore, while making friends was difficult, VMT really made me feel like I was part of something special at TJ. I’ve had several opportunities to work with so many amazingly smart people that have now become my closest friends. While teachers might throw projects and deadlines at me at variable frequency, VMT has been a constant joy that I could hold onto. I wouldn’t trade my time in VMT for anything else in the world.”"

The attendance at TJIMO was the largest since the pandemic, and we had a blast hosting a day of math for everyone. It was amazing to see familiar faces from TJIMO among the incoming freshmen to TJ. The connections we make through math carry on throughout the years and can only be strengthened at VMT.”"
